//HASH TABLES
/*
Hash tables are data strucuture that efficiently stores and retrieve data
into key-value pairs approach.

JavaScript has build-in hash table with is objects {}


// Thinks to keep in mind

1. One way 

2. Deterministic


// Managing Collisions

1) Separate Chaining
Separate chaining is the precess of placing all the key-value pairs that are mapped in 
a particular address in an one array or using linked-list.
example1= arrays in array
eg:- array that holds the address number [["key":"values"], ["key":"values"]]

exmaple 2: Linked-list
key1->key2->key3->key4


2) Linear Probing
(Open addressing)
Linear Probing is the precess that places key-value pairs in an open address, and it kept looping 
until it finds and open address to store the key-value data.

// Js
{
"name": "Adam"
}
*/

//console.log(hash("paul"))

console.log(charCodeAt('nails'))
