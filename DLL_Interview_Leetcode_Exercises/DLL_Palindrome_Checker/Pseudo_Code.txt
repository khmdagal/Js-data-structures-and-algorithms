Pseudo Code:

Method isPalindrome:

    - If the length of the list is 0 or 1, 
      return true (since an empty list or a single element list is a palindrome).



    - Initialize two pointers:

        1. forwardNode pointing to the head of the list.

        2. backwardNode pointing to the tail of the list.



    - Loop for half the length of the list (rounded down):

        - If the value of forwardNode is not equal to the value of backwardNode, return false.

          (This means that the list is not a palindrome since corresponding values from both ends are different.)

        - Move forwardNode to the next node (forwardNode = forwardNode.next).

        - Move backwardNode to the previous node (backwardNode = backwardNode.prev).



    - If the loop completes without returning false, return true.

      (This means all corresponding values from both ends matched, so the list is a palindrome.)
