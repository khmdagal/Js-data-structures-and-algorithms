============= DLL: Palindrome Checker ( ** Interview Question). ===============

Implement a member function called isPalindrome() 
that checks if a doubly linked list is a palindrome.

A doubly linked list is a palindrome if the sequence of values read from the 
head to the tail is the same as the sequence of values read from the tail to the head.


Output:
Return a boolean value: true if the doubly linked list is a palindrome, and false otherwise.


Constraints:
You can only traverse the doubly linked list once.


Example 1:
Suppose you have a DoublyLinkedList object, list, with the following values:
1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 1

After calling the isPalindrome() function:

const result = list.isPalindrome();

result should be true, as the doubly linked list is a palindrome.



Example 2:
Now suppose you have a DoublyLinkedList object, list, with the following values:
3 <-> 1 <-> 2

After calling the isPalindrome() function:

const result = list.isPalindrome();

result should be false, as the doubly linked list is not a palindrome.
