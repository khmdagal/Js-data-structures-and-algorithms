Pseudo Code:

1. Initialize current pointer to the head of the list

2. Initialize temp pointer to null

3. Loop while current pointer is not null

   a. Set temp pointer to the previous node of the current pointer

   b. Set the previous node of the current pointer to the next node of the current pointer

   c. Set the next node of the current pointer to the temp pointer

   d. Move current pointer to the previous node of the current pointer

4. Set temp pointer to the head of the list

5. Set the head of the list to the tail of the list

6. Set the tail of the list to the temp pointer
