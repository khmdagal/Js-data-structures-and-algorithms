DLL: Partition List ( ** Interview Question)
Write a method partitionList(x) that rearranges a doubly linked list so that all nodes with values less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

The relative order of nodes in each partition should remain the same as in the original list.

This operation should modify the list in-place.





Examples:

Input: 3 <-> 8 <-> 5 <-> 10 <-> 2 <-> 1, x = 5
Output: 3 <-> 2 <-> 1 <-> 8 <-> 5 <-> 10
 
Input: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3, x = 5
Output: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3
 
Input: 6 <-> 7 <-> 8, x = 5
Output: 6 <-> 7 <-> 8
