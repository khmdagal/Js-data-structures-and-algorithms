ðŸ“‹ Pseudocode Outline

Create two dummy nodes to start two separate lists.

Traverse the list:

If node value < x, add it to the first list.

Else, add it to the second list.

Connect the end of the first list to the start of the second.

Update the listâ€™s head and fix the prev pointers.





ðŸ’¡ Hints

Use dummy1 for nodes < x and dummy2 for nodes >= x.

Detach each node from the original list by setting next and prev to null before moving it.

Donâ€™t forget to set the new head after combining the two lists.

Always re-link prev pointers properly.





ðŸ“Š Step-by-Step Example (Visual Walkthrough)

Input: 3 <-> 8 <-> 5 <-> 10 <-> 2 <-> 1, x = 5



Initial state:

Original: 3 <-> 8 <-> 5 <-> 10 <-> 2 <-> 1


Partition logic:

3 goes to the first list

8, 5, 10 go to the second list

2, 1 go to the first list



Resulting lists:

List 1 (dummy1): 3 <-> 2 <-> 1
List 2 (dummy2): 8 <-> 5 <-> 10


Final result after merge:

3 <-> 2 <-> 1 <-> 8 <-> 5 <-> 10
