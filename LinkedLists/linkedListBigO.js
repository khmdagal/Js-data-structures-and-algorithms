Unshifting (Adding Elements at the beginning)          O(1)                    O(n)
Shifting (Removing Elements from the beginning)        O(1)                    O(n)
Pushing (Adding Elements at the end)                   O(1)                    O(1)
Poping (Removing Elements from the end)                O(n)                    O(1)
Inserting (Adding Elements at a specific index)        O(n)                    O(n)
Deleting (Removing Elements at a specific index)       O(n)                    O(n)
Looking up By INDEX (Accessing Elements)               O(n)                    O(1)

* The Big O notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
* It describes the worst-case scenario of an algorithm's performance.
* It is used to compare the efficiency of different algorithms.
* It is used to analyze the performance of an algorithm in terms of time and space complexity.
