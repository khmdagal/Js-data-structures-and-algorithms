Pseudocode Outline

Create a dummy node pointing to the head

Initialize previous as dummy and first as head

While first and first.next are not null:

Set second = first.next

Reassign pointers to swap:

previous.next = second

first.next = second.next

second.next = first

Move previous to first

Move first to first.next

Update this.head to dummy.next





ðŸ’¡ Hints

A dummy node simplifies edge cases, especially for swapping at the head

Don't create a new list â€” you must swap actual nodes

Always update pointers in the correct order

The key pattern is A -> B -> C becoming B -> A -> C





ðŸ“Š Step-by-Step Example (Visual Walkthrough)

Input: 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 â†’ 5

Swap 1 and 2 â†’ 2 â†’ 1 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 â†’ 5

Swap 3 and 4 â†’ 2 â†’ 1 â†’ 4 â†’ 3 â†’ 5

Node 5 has no pair â†’ leave it

Final Output: 2 â†’ 1 â†’ 4 â†’ 3 â†’ 5
