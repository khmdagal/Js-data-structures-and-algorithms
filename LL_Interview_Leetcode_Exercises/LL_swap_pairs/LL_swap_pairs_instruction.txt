LL: Swap Pairs ( ** Interview Question)
Write a method called swapPairs that swaps every two adjacent nodes in a singly linked list.

If the list has an odd number of nodes, the last node remains in place.

You may NOT just swap values. You must actually swap the nodes.





ðŸ§ª Examples:

Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
Output: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3
 
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Output: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5
 
Input: 1
Output: 1
 
Input: empty list
Output: empty list
