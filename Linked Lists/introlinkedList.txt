What is Linked lists

Linked lists is fundamental concept of data structure in computer science. It mainly involves EFFICIENT insertion and deletion operations
compared to Arrays.

1) Data Structure                   Non-contiguous                                          Contiguous

2) Memory Allocation      Allocated one by one to individual elements               Allocated to the whole array
                                 
3) Insertion/Deletion                   Efficient                                           Inefficient
      (performance)

4) Access                               Sequential                                             Random

5) Index                                   No                                                    Yes

6) Head/tail                               Yes                                                    No

7) Caches misses                           Yes                                                    No



*** Compared to Array ***
-> Arrays have indexes
-> Array are in contiguous places in memory

Linked Lists 

-> Linked Lists don't have indexes
-> Linked Lists can be any where in the memory, unlike array

*** Head, Tail and null ***
-> head : points to the first item in the list
-> tail : points to the last item in the list
-> null : last item in the list points "null" eg: "null terminated list" 
-> important each item in the list points to the next until the last item
